# Chaos Labs Interview Yayyy
this project will be made a bit like with damnvulnerabledefi I think it's a good architecture to start with and present and test

## What is this project about
 implement a simple liquidator agent script to run against an EVM fork. We recommend using Hardhat or Foundry(Anvil/forge). The agent should receive a list of accounts on Aave and monitor them for liquidation eligibility. Once any account is eligible the agent should liquidate (buy the collateral) and sell it back on any desired DEX for profit.

## How i will proceed this project?
To make this I will open issues I will consider finished when I solved them cleanly with tests.
If I have at the end I will document all the process and the problems I had and how I solved them.

## Personal help.
Since I have already worked with some AAVE developers and made a similar project, I won't have to start from scratch since I already have some code that can help.
